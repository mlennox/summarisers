messing with some approaches to summarising text with machine learning

## pre-requisites

- Python 3.6.6 / pip 18.0 (I use Pyenv and virutalenv)
- Tensorflow

### Preparing the environment

Load the python dependencies by running

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Example 1 - Sequence to Sequence

LSTM with Attention

## Example 2 - BiLSTM with Attention

## Example 3 - Seq2Seq with pointer and coverage
